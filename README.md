# Custom titanspawns  

Custom titanspawns. Made less as a faithful recreation and more as a private endeavor to make custom titanspawn attacks. 
Functionally accurate for the most part, but a lot of things aren't 100% visually accurate. If you want pure accuracy, this library is not for you.

> Looks the best on 30 FPS, it's recommended you use that!
